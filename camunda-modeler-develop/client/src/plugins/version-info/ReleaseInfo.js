          <h4>Improved History Time to Live Configuration</h4>
          For Camunda 7 diagrams, the History Time to Live (HTTL) is no longer automatically set, preventing accidental overrides of globally configured HTTL settings. Learn more about configuring HTTL options in <a href="https://docs.camunda.io/docs/next/components/modeler/reference/modeling-guidance/rules/history-time-to-live/">our documentation</a>.
